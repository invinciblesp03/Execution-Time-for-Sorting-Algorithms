# Execution-Time-for-Sorting-Algorithms
This is a project that will find the execution time for sorting algorithms including selection sort, insertion sort, quick sort and shell sort. It also determines the number of comparisons and swaps for all sorting algorithms at once.
First of all you will be asked for a number for which the program will generate random numbers and will then sort them to find the number of swaps and comparisons taken for each sorting and the time taken for execution by each sorting algorithm.
